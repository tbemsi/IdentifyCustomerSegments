# IdentifyCustomerSegments

## Project Motivation
In this project, I apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify
segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order
sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing
campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
The data used was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

## Libraries Used
* Numpy
* Pandas

## Main results from analysis

The typical customer of the company is a young male, who is combative, dominant-minded, highly mobile,
not very religious, not very dutiful, has a high affinity for events, and not family-oriented. He will tend 
to live in the areas with a high proportion of 1-2 family homes. 

People least likely to be customers of this company are immigrants to Germany, who live in the poorer parts 
of East Germany, and come from households with large numbers of adults and children.
